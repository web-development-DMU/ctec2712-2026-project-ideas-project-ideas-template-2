<h3>Intent</h3>
 <p>
    Where going to make a template on draw.io for what we think the sites pages should look like. There are going to be about 3 - 4 pages.
 </p>
<ul>
    <li>1st page - The main sites page where all of the resturants will be featured.</li>
    <li>2nd page - This page will be where the individual resturant will be featured.</li>
    <li>3rd page - This will be the review pages which can also be added into the second page for less clutter</li>
    <li>4th page - A profile page for every user</li>
</ul>
<p> Each page will be dedicated to a team member to think about a design and the resources that will be used.</p>
