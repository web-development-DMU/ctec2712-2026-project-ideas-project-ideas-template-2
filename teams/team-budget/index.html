    <h2> Application</h2>
    
    <h3>Budget buddy</h3>
    <p>
Budget Buddy is a web application designed to help users manage their personal finances.
The system allows users to record income and expenses, organise transactions into categories,
set monthly budgets, and track their spending habits. The goal is to provide a simple and
clear way for users to monitor their financial activity and make better budgeting decisions.
</p>

    <h2>About Our Team</h2>
     
        <p>
We are a team of students developing a Budget Tracker web application to help users manage
their income, expenses, and financial goals. Our system focuses on simplicity, organisation,
and clear financial tracking.
</p>

<h2>Implemented By</h2>
<p>
This application is being implemented by 
<a href="../teams/team-budget/index.html">Team Budget</a>.
</p>
 <h2> Team members</h2>
    <ul>
<li><a href="../../people/P2870020.html">Saad Hamrad</a></li>
 <li><a href="../../people/P2868977.html">Femi Yeku</a></li>
    
<h2>Technical Considerations</h2>

<p>
The Budget Buddy application will be structured as a simple CRUD web system.
Users will interact with HTML forms to create, read, update, and delete financial data.
Navigation will be handled using hyperlinks and anchor links to allow users to move
between documentation sections easily.
</p>

<p>
The application will include a clear separation between the user interface and the
database structure. Future development will include HTTP communication between the
client and server, route handling, and structured data processing.

    </ul>
