            As a team, we are excited to build a complete web application for this project. With a mix of skills such as HTML, css, and javascript, we hope to create a solid website reinforced by an idea that could actually turn into a useful service.

        <h5><u><b>Our proposal</b></u></h5>
        <p>
            Our idea is to create a gamified productivity manager.
            Users will be able to set activities and tasks, allowing them to track their progress based on objectives they set themselves. 
            When they complete tasks, they get rewarded with XP, allowing the users to level up and receive rewards for completing their tasks.
            Users will be able to compare their progress to others via leaderboards.
            The program will show a calendar of activities based on what the user inputs into the app, allowing users to easily track their activities and tasks.
