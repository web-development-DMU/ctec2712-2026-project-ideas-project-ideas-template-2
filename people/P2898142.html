    <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
    <p>I completed a computer science GCSE, and an IT CTEC at post 16 level, so I have slight previous experience within web development. However there is still a lot to learn and relearn.</p>
    <p>In this module I am hoping to gain some good experience in web development and be able to confidently handle all content involved within the module.</p>
    <h2>Project ideas</h2>
    <p>I have drafted some project ideas and have created a list below of the ones I think stood out along with a brief explanations of what they could contain:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Movie recommendation site:<br> 
            This could be a site where we have a user profile tab with info about the user. This could be favourite movie, genre, top 5 film list etc. There could then be a global recommendation tab with highest rated films scored out of 10 and then a few sub tabs with genres. Maybe a highest rated film of the month for new films that month. </li>
        <li>Restaurant recommendation/review site:<br>
             This could have list of restaurants local to DMU campus. user ratings, different tabs for cuisines. There can be a map section that links to directions or says distance from campus. Business hours for the restaurants listed, average cost for a meal, average wait time during peak hours.
        </li>
        <li>Student club page:<br>
            This could have tabs for a variety of the clubs available at DMU, events coming up, how to get involved in the club. Each club can have a introduction page that displays some info about them, what they typically do etc.</li>

    </ul>

<p>These are the base layouts for a few of the pages I will be working on within the module. </p>
<p>First is the review page, this is where the users of the site will be able to a leave a review on one of the restaurants </p>
