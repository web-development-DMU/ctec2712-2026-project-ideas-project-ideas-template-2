        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a second year Computer Science student at DMU who has explored
          here and there in web applications with an interest in building
          structured, reliable web applications. I enjoy understanding how
          systems work from frontend layout to backend logic.

        <h2>Web Development Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I have experimented with building web applications and have experience
          working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git workflows. Through this
          module, I am developing a more structured understanding of full web
          application development lifecycle.

        <h2>What I Want to Learn</h2>
        <p>
          I want to strengthen my understanding of semantic HTML, CSS structure,
          Git branching workflows, and server-side development using Deno. I am
          particularly interested in implementing full CRUD functionality with
          SQLite and designing clean application architecture.

      <section>
        <h2>Project Interests</h2>
        <p>
          I would like to be involved in building a structured multi-page web
          application that demonstrates proper CRUD operations, server routing,
          and database integration.
