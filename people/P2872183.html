                Who am I?
                Hello, my name is Thanaa, and I'm a second year computer science student.
               
                What experience do I have in web development?
                I have little experience in web development but its been a long time, so I'll have to refresh my knowledge of it.Though I do remember enjoying the learning process thoroughly.

                What am I keen to learn from this module?
                I am keen to learn how to use CSS and HTM  (again...),and JavaScript, which I've never attempted before.
                And in the coming weeks we'll be developing our applications, so that's something I'm looking forward to.
               
                What kind of project would I like to be involved in?
               
            </p>
            <h2>A list of project ideas:</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>Money Management:
                   - Tracking use of money, perhaps gain insight from AI... </li>

                <li>Student Forum:
                 -website where DMU students (and maybe staff members) can interact with each other
                 Gain insight/advice, converse, share ideas etc. Students can also use the website to promote events, personal projects.
                 Or even give feedback of modules ...
                </li>

                <li> Knowledge and memory Game:
                 - tests the students knoweldge of the module, in different ways. Quizzes, fill in the gaps, etc.
                 - Something creative e.g. involves the customisation of character, written bio etc.
                 - May be able to challenge other students on leader board.
                 - Progress is tracked and points are given.  
                 - Motivation/Insight given to students performance for improvement.
                </li>
           
            </ul>
