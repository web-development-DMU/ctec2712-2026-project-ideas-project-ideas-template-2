<h1>my experiince with web development</h1>
<p> my experice with web developmentis is minor where I have used html ,css and java 
    for creating own webste with feautures such as nav bar, hotspot and furthermore to create 
    own website project.  
</p>
<p>
the project I created was based upon using notepad++ where we created html files
 in personal sub folder for project and utlized notepad++ to write the code for html, css and java.
 I have created an website one which was movie review website and second one was upon motorbikes 
 where you could see the descriptiuon of the image which was related upon the website, so overall
 i have minor experince with web development.

<h2>Application ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>my first suggestion would be an trabel booking system for example user can book whatever transport
    they are looking for such as Bus, Taxi and flights including various features to have an easy interface for user.
</li>
<li> My Another suggestion wopuld be an food recipes where the user can look at food dish and get an full description
    for the dish for example the description may include short review,receipe and video tutorial so user can review the dish 
    or try it for himself and gain knowledge how it is made and knowing the prccoess for cooking that dish.
</li>
<li>A third application idea would be an personal log</li>
<li>A personal log would be an site where user could have section for personal infomration input 
    futhermore an events and memeory sectioon where person can save the media linked with the date, overall 
    it is an personal diary but digital with more feautress and accesbility to keep user intersted to view back 
    or keeping notes.
</li>
