    <h1>Muhammad Hassan Akmal</h1>
    <p>I am a second-year student majoring in Computer Science. I have previous experience in web development and 
        software engineering. I am passionate about creating efficient and scalable software solutions.</p>
    <p>During this module,I want to improve my understanding of software design principles and best practices.
        I am also interested in learning about new technologies and tools that can help me become a better software engineer.</p>
    <p>For my project, I am interested in developing a web application that can help students manage
        their coursework and assignments more effectively. I am open to 
        feedback and suggestions from my peers and instructors to help me refine my project idea.</p>
    <p>Some tentative project ideas I have are:
        <ul>
            <li>An E commerce website for pet lovers to buy products</li>
            <li>A social media platform for sharing study resources</li>
            <li>An E commerce website for selling Mobile Accessories
            
                I have experience building and managing e-commerce websites. 
                I have created online stores, listed products, and worked on 
                selling mobile accessories through online platforms. I also 
                have experience running online advertisements and promoting 
                 products on social media.
