    <h1>Muhammad Ismail</h1>

    <p>
        I am Muhammad Ismail, a Computer Science student at De Montfort University with a strong interest in web development and building practical applications. I enjoy creating clean, user friendly interfaces and working on projects that solve real problems. I am interested in how simple design choices can improve user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of my key projects is <strong>Quill</strong>, a digital journaling web application. I built this website while following a YouTube tutorial to understand the core structure, layout and styling. This project helped me strengthen my HTML, CSS, and layout design skills while learning how to turn a concept into a usable product.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this module, I am looking forward to improving my web development skills further, especially in building interactive features and working collaboratively in a team. My goal is to create applications that are simple, meaningful, and genuinely useful for everyday users.
