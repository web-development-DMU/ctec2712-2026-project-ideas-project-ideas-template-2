    <h1>Abdishakur Said</h1>
    <p>I don't have much experience when it comes to web development. 
        I've studied a bit of html through a freeCodeCamp course. 
        I've done very minimal html over the past 2 years. I am hoping to gain adequate experience
        in developing web applications by the end of this module.

    <h2>Application Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>wiki that summarises certain pieces of media</li>
        <li>puzzle website that takes any image and turns it into a puzzle test second version</li>
    </ul>
