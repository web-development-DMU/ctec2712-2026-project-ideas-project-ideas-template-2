    <h1>Abdishakur Said</h1>
    <p>I don't have much experience when it comes to web development. 
        I've studied a bit of html through a freeCodeCamp course. 
        I've done very minimal html over the past 2 years. I am hoping 
        to gain adequate experience in developing web applications by
        the end of this module. I enjoy graphic design as I did it in clubs during sixth form and 
        also took graphic design as a subject for my GCSEs. Thus I am looking forward to learning CSS aswell as integrating
        it the web application that I will be developing over this module.
    </p>
    <h2>Application Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>wiki that summarises certain pieces of media</li>
        <li>puzzle website that takes any image and turns it into a puzzle</li>
        <li>converts a number into a roman numeral, could be potentially expanded to then involve other number systems</li>
        <li>networking site for dmu students, can make their own profiles detailing their social media, interests, course they are taking ect.</li>
