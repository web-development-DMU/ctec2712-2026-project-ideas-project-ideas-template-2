        <p>
        I am currently a university student learning the fundameeental of web development.
        I have some experience working with computers and programming through my coursework,
        including building a hotel management system in C#. This is my first time working
        directly with HTML to create web pages.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have seen HTML and CSS before but have not used them extensively. I am looking forward
            to learning how to properly structure web pages, style them using CSS, and later add
            interactivity with JavaScript. My goal is to build practical skills that I can use for
            future placements and real-world projects.
        </p>
