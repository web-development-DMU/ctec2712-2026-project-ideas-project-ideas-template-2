        <h2>Application ideas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> first suggestion is an event planner. This event planner is going to allow you to create, view, delete and update events, invite people, track attendences, include date, location and descriptions.</li>
           
            <li>um maybe a school hub web page where you can besically find your grades, upcoming lessons and exams or assigments.Youll be able to find your teacher contacts and more information on modules. Lastly, see your current attendance and also be able to check in with  code.  </li>
