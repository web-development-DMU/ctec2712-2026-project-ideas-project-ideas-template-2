Welcome to my personal webpage!

<p>
I am a second year computer science student at the esteemed De Montfort University. I have a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and I am eager to explore the exciting possibilities that these fields offer. I am extremely interested in the implications of generative AI and its potential to revolutionize various industries. I am particularly fascinated by the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI and the impact it may have on society. I am excited to learn more about these topics and contribute to the ongoing discussions in the field of AI.

I am currently refining my skills in coding and exploring new languages and frameworks to enhance my web development capabilities.
