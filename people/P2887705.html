    <h1>Devapriya Subin</h1>

    <p>As a second‑year Computer Science student, I’m beginning to explore web application development in a more structured and practical way.
         I’ve had some exposure to HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, but I’m keen to deepen my understanding of how real web applications are designed, built, and deployed.</p>

    <p>This module is a chance for me to strengthen my front‑end skills, learn better development practices like version control with Git, and gain confidence working collaboratively on shared projects.</p>
