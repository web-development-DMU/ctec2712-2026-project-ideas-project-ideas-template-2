<h1>MY INTRO</h1>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I'm Vinjazer. I like gaming and football.</p>

<h2>What experience do I have in web development?</h2>
<p>Honestly? Barely anything. <br> I've poked around HTML a tiny bit, like enough to know it exists.<br> CSS is that thing that makes stuff look pretty (I think?).<br> And Git? Yeah, that's the thing everyone fights with, right? Total beginner here, learning as I go!</p>

<h2>What am I keen to learn from this module?</h2>
<p>Would be cool to build something that looks decent and actually does stuff. Also wouldn't mind learning the secrets so I don't have to Google every little thing</p>

<h2>What kind of project would I like to be involved in?</h2>
<p>Okay so I've got this idea, <br>A property realtor & educational site. Think of it like a one-stop shop where both regular people AND realtors can actually learn about property stuff AND find deals. <br>Like if Rightmove and a property course had a baby. Realtors can level up their knowledge, regular people can figure out what is going on with house prices, and everyone can find actual property deals. <br>Makes sense right?</p>

<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
<ul>
            <li><strong>Property Realtor & Educational Hub</strong> - A chill site where realtors come to learn and find property deals. No boring corporate vibes, just useful stuff for people who actually work with properties. And maybe regular people can sneak in and learn too 🤫</li>
            <li><em>(Might think of more later, but this is the main one I'm vibing with)</em></li>
        </ul>
