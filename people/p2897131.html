    <h1>Yasmine Maymani</h1>

    <p>
        I am Yasmine Maymani studying Software Engineering at DMU currently in my second year, I have some experience with web development through university modules and small projects. I understand the basics of HTML and CSS, and I have been experimented with JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through this module, I want to improve my understanding of how modern web applications are built, learn to structure pages properly, and gain more confidence with front‑end technologies. Also to be able to build clean and user-friendly, functional web pages and eventually move on to more advanced concepts.
    </p>

    <h2>Application ideas</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Study planner web application that help student to manage their life style and studies</li>
        <li>Simple budgeting and expense tracker</li>
        <li>A student‑focused app that lists upcoming university events — workshops, society meetings, sports fixtures, and social gatherings. Users could filter by category, save events, or get notifications when something new is added.</li>
        <li>Fitness habit tracker with progress charts</li>
        <li>
            Recipe organiser users can save recipes, add ingredients, 
            and generate a shopping list automatically
        </li>
