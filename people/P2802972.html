            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Elisha Muganda, a Computer Science student who has some with web development. I'm eager to grow my skills and take on new challenges throughout this course.
                My experience is fairly limited at the moment. I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, but would like to fully understand both. I'm still getting comfortable with how web pages are structured and styled.
                I want to properly understand how CSS works and how to use it effectively to style pages. Beyond that, I'm keen to learn how full web applications are built and how the front-end and back-end connect together.
                I'd like to work on something practical that I can actually see being used in real life. I want a project that challenges me to learn as I build, rather than one that relies on skills I don't yet have.

            <h2>Project Idea</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Student Budget Tracker</a> - A web app aimed at helping students stay on top of their finances. The idea is to have a simple interface where you can log your income and expenses, split them into categories like food, transport and entertainment, and see at a glance how much you have left for the month. A lot of students, myself included, find it easy to lose track of spending without realising it, so having a lightweight tool built specifically for students rather than a complicated banking app could genuinely be useful.</li>
