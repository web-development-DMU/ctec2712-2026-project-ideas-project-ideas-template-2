            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Elisha Muganda, a Computer Science student who has some with web development. I'm eager to grow my skills and take on new challenges throughout this course.
            </p>

            <h2>What experience do I have in web development?</h2>
            <p>
                My experience is fairly limited at the moment. I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, but would like to fully understand both. I'm still getting comfortable with how web pages are structured and styled.
            </p>

            <h2>What am I keen to learn from this module?</h2>
            <p>
                I want to properly understand how CSS works and how to use it effectively to style pages. Beyond that, I'm keen to learn how full web applications are built and how the front-end and back-end connect together.
            </p>

            <h2>What kind of project would I like to be involved in?</h2>
            <p>
                I'd like to work on something practical that I can actually see being used in real life. I want a project that challenges me to learn as I build, rather than one that relies on skills I don't yet have.
