            <h2>Breif Description of the Application:</h2>
            <p>
                Grind Archives is a web application where users create a profile and curate a public gaming portfolio. 
                Users can add games and record structured statistics such as hours played, achievements or trophies earned, 
                completion status, platform, and personal notes. Profiles can be shared publicly, 
                allowing other users to browse and search player archives. 
                The platform also aims to support optional stat verification and community interaction features to enhance credibility and engagement.
            </p>

            <h2>A Few Paragraphs of the Application</h2>
    
                <h3>What Problem It Solves</h3>
            <p>
                Many gamers track progress across multiple platforms (PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, Switch). 
                Even when platforms show stats, they are often locked inside that platform and not presented 
                as a single “portfolio” that’s easy to share. Grind Archives centralises that information 
                and lets the player present it in a clean, personalised profile.
            </p>
            <h3>What The User Experience Is Like</h3>
            <p>
                A user signs up, creates a profile (bio, favourite genres, “currently grinding”, etc.), 
                then adds games to their archive. Each game entry includes structured fields (hours played, 
                trophies/achievements, completion %) plus optional personal notes. The user can edit entries over time, 
                and their profile automatically reflects updates.
            </p>
            <h3>Why It Fits In This Module</h3>
            <p>
                This is a CRUD application with an HTML interface: users can Create profiles/game entries, 
                Read (view) profiles and game archives, Update stats and details, and Delete games or accounts. 
                The structure naturally supports multiple database tables (aiming for 3–4+ tables), which matches 
                the project expectations.
            </p>
