      <p>
        Nutrti-Track is the name of our application and is a browser-based application that allows users to calculate nutritional content of meals by selecting foods,
        entering quantities and viewing totals for calories, macronutrients, and key vitamins/minerals.
        Built using html,css and javascript as it aims to be fast and accessible for everyday users.
       
      </p>
      <p>
        NutriTrack is designed to help users make informed dietary choices without needing a complex app. The application will allow users to search for foods, add them to a meal,
        and instantly see nutritional totals. It can pull data from a built in database.
        The interface will focus on clarity: a search bar, a food list, a meal builder, and a results panel. Users can adjust quantities, remove items, and save meals locally using browser storage.
        Administrators may have access to a backend interface to update food data, add new items, or correct nutritional values. Administrator will have access to
        manage the users data such as username, email and password which will be encrypted.
