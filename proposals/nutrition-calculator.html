      <p>
        Nutrti-Track is the name of our application and is a browser-based application that allows users to calculate nutritional content of meals by selecting foods,
        entering quantities and viewing totals for calories, macronutrients, and key vitamins/minerals.
        Built using html,css and javascript as it aims to be fast and accessible for everyday users.
       
      </p>
      <p>
        NutriTrack is designed to help users make informed dietary choices without needing a complex app or login system. The application will allow users to search for foods, add them to a meal,
        and instantly see nutritional totals. It can pull data from a built in database.
        The interface will focus on clarity: a search bar, a food list, a meal builder, and a results panel. Users can adjust quantities, remove items, and save meals locally using browser storage.
        Administrators may have access to a backend interface to update food data, add new items, or correct nutritional values. Administrator will have access to
        manage the users data such as username, email and password which will be encrypted.

      <h3>Challenges / Risks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implementing the many-to-many relationship between programmes and
          exercises correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designing a simple and intuitive user interface without relying
          heavily on JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>Managing user authentication securely.</li>
        <li>
          Ensuring data consistency when editing or deleting exercises from
          programmes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Data Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>User account information (name, email, encrypted password).</li>
        <li>Workout programme details created by each user.</li>
        <li>Exercise information including name and category.</li>
        <li>
          Programme-specific data such as sets, repetitions, and exercise
          order.
        </li>
        <li>Basic security measures to protect user login data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Database Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        One gym member (user) can create many workout programmes, but each
        programme belongs to one user. This is a one-to-many relationship
        between Users and Programmes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A programme can contain many exercises, and the same exercise can
        appear in many programmes. This creates a many-to-many relationship
        between Programmes and Exercises, which is resolved using the
        Programme_Exercises junction table.
      </p>
