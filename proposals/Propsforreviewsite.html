    <title>Proposals for review site</title>
<body>
<p>
    
    This site is for the review of our proposed templates for our projects pages.
    The templates for these pages are under review and are subject to change at any time and
    we will be updating them as soon as possible to reflect said changes.
</p>    
<p>
    The picture below is the pictures for the registration and the login pages.
    These pages of the site wouuld have both get and post requests due to being anchor pages.
    Unless we add a visitor functionality where users can skip the post part and just view the site without signing up or logging in.
</p>

<p>
    The image below is the template for the restaurant page which is one of the main parts of our project.
    This page wouldn't have much input functionality from the client side so it is primarily get only unless we change the plan 
    and add a feature where users can review the restaurant directly on the restaurants page instead of getting redirected to the review page.
</p>

<p>
    The image below is the template for the reviews page which is another one of the main parts of our project which will carry
    a lot of functionality.
    If we do all of our planned features this page will have both get and post requests which will consist of multiple forms of
    Liking and disliking reviews , posting reviews, and replying to reviews (BIG optional).
    CHANGE IT TO A SCROLL WHEEL FORMAT. NO NEXT OR PREVIOUS BUTTONS.
</p>

<p>
   The image below is the optional page for profiles and this may be cancelled depending on how much we can get done.
   This page will also have a lot of get and post requests while also probably being the most complex page of the site due to the
   amount of small features we want to cram in it.
