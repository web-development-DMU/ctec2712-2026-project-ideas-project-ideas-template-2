            <p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                An application where students and local residence can rate and place food reviews, and discover the ratings of a resturant that a user has placed.
                Its also for returant owners where they can sign up or contact the adminsitrator for their resturant to be advertised on the application, where they can view their clients comments.
            </p>

            <h4> Application integrity</h4>
            <p>
                It needs an admin system so administrators can view comments and reviews. Also to ensure application integrity if actor/s are attempting malicious intent by unethical application penetration.
