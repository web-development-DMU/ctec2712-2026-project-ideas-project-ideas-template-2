        <h2>Gym Programme Planner</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          So the idea is that it's a website for a gym. It allows gym members to
          create and manage their own workout programmes. Members can register
          for an account and build personalised training plans by selecting
          exercises from a predefined exercise library. Users can organise
          exercises into structured routines and update sets and repetitions
          when needed. The system stores user accounts, exercises and workout
          programmes in a database.
        </p>
        <p>
          It needs an admin system so administrators can manage the exercise
          records and categories. Administrators can create, update and delete
          exercises to ensure the library remains accurate and organised.
        </p>

        <p>
          This web application will be intended for gym members who want
          structured planning, as it will help maintain consistency and
          progression, replacing paper notes and memory-based planning. It keeps
          workouts organised and accessible.

        <h3>User Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As a gym member, I want to register so that I can save my
            programmes.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a gym member, I want to create a workout programme so that I can

          </li>
          <li>

        <h3>Database Relationships</h3>
        <p>
          One gym member (user) can create many workout programmes, but each
          programme belongs to one user. This is a one-to-many relationship
          between Users and Programmes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A programme can contain many exercises, and the same exercise can
          appear in many programmes. This creates a many-to-many relationship
          between Programmes and Exercises, which is resolved using the
          Programme_Exercises junction table.

        <h3>Draft Database Structure</h3>

        <h4>Users</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>user_id (Primary key)</li>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>email</li>
          <li>password</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Programmes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>programme_id (Primary key)</li>
          <li>user_id (Foreign key)</li>
          <li>programme_name</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Exercises</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>exercise_id (Primary key)</li>
          <li>exercise_name</li>
          <li>category</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Programme_Exercises</h4>
        <p>
          This is a junction table used to link Programmes and Exercises. It
          stores which exercises are included in each programme, as well as
          programme specific details such as sets and reps.
        </p>
