        <p>
          So the idea is that it's a website for a Gym/Fitness enthusiast. It
          allows gym members to create and manage their own workout programmes.
          Guests/Visitors can register for an account and build personalised
          training plans by selecting exercises from a predefined exercise
          library. Users can organise exercises into structured routines and
          update sets and repetitions when needed. The system stores user
          accounts, exercises and workout programmes in a database.
        </p>
        <p>
          It needs an admin system so administrators can manage the exercise
          records and categories. Administrators can create, update and delete
          exercises and routines to ensure the library remains accurate and
          organised. Administrator will have access to manage the users data
          such as username, email and password which will be encrypted.
        </p>

        <p>
          This web application will be intended for gym members who want
          structured planning, as it will help maintain consistency and
          progression, replacing paper notes and memory-based planning. It keeps
          workouts organised and accessible.

            Implementing the many-to-many relationship between programmes and
            exercises correctly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designing a simple and intuitive user interface without relying
            heavily on JavaScript.

        <h3>Data Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>User account information (name, email, encrypted password).</li>
          <li>Workout programme details created by each user.</li>
          <li>Exercise information including name and category.</li>
          <li>
            Programme-specific data such as sets, repetitions, and exercise

        <h3>Database Relationships</h3>
        <p>
          One gym member (user) can create many workout programmes, but each
          programme belongs to one user. This is a one-to-many relationship
          between Users and Programmes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A programme can contain many exercises, and the same exercise can
          appear in many programmes. This creates a many-to-many relationship
          between Programmes and Exercises, which is resolved using the
          Programme_Exercises junction table.
