        <h1>Car Wash Booking System and Project Layout</h1>
        <p>This car wash booking system is proposed by <a href="/project-ideas-lab-group-09/people/P2882530.html" id="intro">Milan Paudel</a>.</p>
        <p>Users can create an account or log in to their existing account.</p>
        <p>Users can search for a car wash and book an available timeslot.</p>
        <p>Admins can create, cancel, and delete timeslots.</p>
        <p>Car washes will be listed, along with their contact info and location.</p>
        <p>Timeslots will also be listed for car washes and can be booked.</p>
